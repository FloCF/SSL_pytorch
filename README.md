# PyTorch Implementation of Self-Supervised Method

## Implementation Plan:

* **Contrastive:** 
    - CPC-v2
    - MoCo-v2,
* **Non-Contrastive:**
    - BYOL (finished),
    - SimSiam (finished),
    - SwAV,
    - BarlowTwins (finished),
    - ...
    
I want to focus on method that also work in a comparably small batch size setting. That's why SimCLR is not part of the list.
